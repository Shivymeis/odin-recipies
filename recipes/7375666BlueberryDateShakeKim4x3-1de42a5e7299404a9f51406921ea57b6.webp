    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>“I’m using crushed cool ranch Doritos for the coating for the Super Bowl … delicious,” says rdmelinda90. “Once a year treat and still healthier than store bought!”

        “These are delicious,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “I added some garlic and extra Parmesan cheese. My family LOVED them!”
